1. HOW THIS WORKS

When you request a spec on IRC (by typing ex. !stbr th-test kernel.spec:LINUX_2_6 smplayer apache)
the STBR-bot will do the following:
- check if the spec exists on given branch, and if it does
- make a list of all the people who commited to this spec, then
- take the first one of them, and check if that one could send an request to builders,
- if so, an email is generated and sent to that person, if not, the second person on the list
  is being checked and so on

2. SETUP

You need to load stbr.tcl into an eggdrop compatible irc-bot (see README.IRCBOT for details). You
will also need to set up some variables in it and prepare a CVS tree in "scripts" directory. Also
put cvslog.sh and requesters-${dist}.txt into scripts directory (symlinks would be fine).

To setup STBR log database, create sqlite file with basic structure:

$ sqlite stbrlog.db "
	create table stbr (
	date datetime primary key not null,
	sender varchar(100) not null);

	create table application (
	date datetime not null,
	spec varchar(100) not null,
	branch varchar(50) not null,
	recipient varchar(100) not null,
	builder varchar(20) not null,
	line varchar(3) not null,
	primary key (date,spec,branch));

	create table status(date datetime not null,
	spec varchar(100) not null,
	branch varchar(50) not null,
	queue_requester varchar(100),
	queue_date datetime,
	queue_flags varchar(30),
	queue_builder_info text,
	primary key (date,spec,branch));"

Database for unfilled requests:

sqlite unfilled.db "create table unfilled ( date datetime not null, spec varchar(100) not null, branch varchar(50) not null, recipient varchar(100) not null, line varchar(3) not null, primary key(date,spec,branch));"

It sucks, but the database & directory with the db need to be world writable.
Now ready to use with TCL script and WWW page.
