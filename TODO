HIGH PRIORITY
- [tcl] registering developers
- [tcl] enhance !del functionality so that a registered developer can remove a request that was sent to him. The developer has to give a reason why he's removing this particular request (ex. a beta version that must not be sent to builders or sth like that)
- [tcl] !abuser add|del nick - which will ignore nicks mask for an hour or so (call internal ignore function from bot)
- [tcl] after implementing these function bum version up to 0.9 and call it rc3 from now on

LOW PRIORITY
- [web] filters, sorting (partially done)
- [web] better anti-spam links
